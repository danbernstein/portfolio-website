          <p>The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a set of tools that make it easy to write code to specify cloud infrastructure and deploy it using common scripting languages, like Python or Javascript. Previously, you had to use YAML or XML templates to deploy AWS cloud infrastructure using the CloudFormation service. The CDK is a wrapper around these templates that makes Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) more accessible and allows you to take advantage of complex operations that you cannot accomplish in template files.</p>

          <p>Issue: I need to copy thousands or millions of files between S3 buckets. This might be because you regularly move data between a test and a production environments or your data architecture has changed and the new bucket names make more sense. Whether you are doing it once or regularly, there are multiple options for moving a large number of files between buckets, and the choice might come down to your familiarity with different AWS computing services, such as Lambda, EC2, and EMR.</p>

          <p>Issue: When working with thousands or millions of files, you will often find discrepancies in number of files and will need to find a quick way to identify where the discrepancies come from. In these situations, the logical solution is a for loop or list comprehension because they both iterate over a list of values, compute something, and return a value. In some situations, these options are not the most efficient because they require each element to be evaluated individually.</p>

          <p>I love cooking, and I am heavily dependent on a couple of websites for new recipe ideas. Oftentimes, these websites contain multiple advertisements to drive revenue or the recipe contains a lot of background information that is not immediately relevant to the recipe, such as the history of the dish or how the chef developed the recipe.
Problem: I love cooking but I hate all of this irrelevant content on recipe websites.</p>

          <p>A quick glance at the list of services available on AWS can be overwhelming. As of September 2020, there are over 160 AWS services, some of which have informative names, such as simple storage service (S3), and others which are incredibly obtuse, like Neptune and Greengrass. The number and variety of services has even inspired catchy songs. Looking at the list, you might start to think, “do I need to use all of those to build my application?</p>

          <p>Summary: This small project started out with two goals: web scraping and visualizing movement data. As the project developed, I found that the web scraping took most of the time, and the visualization was best left to well-developed javascript frameworks, rather than developing it from scratch.
Check out the final visualization.
Webscraping Note: It is extremely important to read and understand the website user agreement for any website from which you might want to scrape data.</p>

          <p>In January 2019, Axios produced a data visualization to demonstrate how the partial government shutdown was impacting different states and how that related to the outcomes of the 2016 presidential election. The visualization is a little confusing because there are two color scales, one for states that went for Trump and another for Clinton. Because the scales are distinguished by the 2016 winner, but the shade on each scale is determined by the number of federal workers affected by the government shutdown, the visualization is a little confusing.</p>

The methodology I pursued in that post was based on a 2012 article in the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH) that conducted an analysis of New York City for bike lanes installed between 1996 and 2006, including limiting analysis to the five years before and two years following a bike lane installation to assess impact.</p>

          <p>At a meeting of the Transportation Techies Meet Up in early 2018, another Techie announced that he had gathered images from traffic cameras around Arlington, VA at intersections with bike lanes. The data is available at here. He suggested that this data would likely be well-suited for computer vision (CV) to automate the process of classifying the images based on whether the bike lane was blocked or not.
I recently decided to learn about computer vision to tackle this challenge.</p>

          <p>The number of bike lanes in DC have proliferated in the past few years, ostensibly providing cyclists with increased safety. However, not all bike lanes are created equal: protected bike lanes with intermittent posts provide greater protection than bike lanes sandwiched between busy streets and parking lanes along the curb. This analysis intends to determine if bike lanes have increased safety, measured in terms of the number of reported crashes involving a cyclist.</p>

          <p>Summary I looked to Kaggle to further practice building predictive models. After optimizing single and ensemble regression techniques, I uncovered ensemble stacking as a method for building a strong predictive model from a collection of weak learners. The outcome is drastic improvements in predictive accuracy. This post will provide an overview of:
the basics of automating data preparation using caret building stacked ensemble modelling using caretEnsemble reason through how the various models that I used improve the ensemble predictions  This post will deal less with the specifics of the dataset, and rather provide an overview of how these packages provide easy, flexible, and powerful methods for developing strong predictive models.</p>
