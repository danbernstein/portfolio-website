      <description>This is the fourth and final post in a series that seek to recreate the methods used in Future ozone-related acute excess mortality under climate and population change scenarios in China: A modeling study. All the posts build on my previous post on forecasting, by using data available from national and international research initatives to project future scenarios for complex systems including atmospheric chemistry, population dynamics, and mortality rate. This post focuses on combining the previous three projections to derive human health outcome metrics: attributable fraction and attributable daily death.</description>
