      <description>I love cooking, and I am heavily dependent on a couple of websites for new recipe ideas. Oftentimes, these websites contain multiple advertisements to drive revenue or the recipe contains a lot of background information that is not immediately relevant to the recipe, such as the history of the dish or how the chef developed the recipe.
Problem: I love cooking but I hate all of this irrelevant content on recipe websites.</description>

      <description>At a meeting of the Transportation Techies Meet Up in early 2018, another Techie announced that he had gathered images from traffic cameras around Arlington, VA at intersections with bike lanes. The data is available at here. He suggested that this data would likely be well-suited for computer vision (CV) to automate the process of classifying the images based on whether the bike lane was blocked or not.
I recently decided to learn about computer vision to tackle this challenge.</description>
