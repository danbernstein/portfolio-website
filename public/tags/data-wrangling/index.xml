      <description>Summary: This small project started out with two goals: web scraping and visualizing movement data. As the project developed, I found that the web scraping took most of the time, and the visualization was best left to well-developed javascript frameworks, rather than developing it from scratch.
Check out the final visualization.
Webscraping Note: It is extremely important to read and understand the website user agreement for any website from which you might want to scrape data.</description>
